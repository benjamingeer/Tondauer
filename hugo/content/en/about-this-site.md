Musicians therefore need *transparent* editions that allow them to
check the editor's choices and to see where different choices are
possible. The ideal of transparency was developed for literary
editions in the 1970s. The Frankfurt Hölderlin edition of 1975
presented:

> "a synoptic genetic text and a reading text with manuscript
> facsimiles accompanied by spatially oriented
> transcriptions.... [T]he facsimiles and transcriptions serve as a
> tool for the reader to check to a certain degree the editor's
> work."[^Nutt-Kofoth]

By providing everything needed to reproduce each step of the editing
process, editors can make it possible for others to build on what they
have done while taking different approaches:

> "Open Source Critical Editions are more than merely presentations of
> finished work; they involve an essential distribution of the raw
> data, the scholarly tradition, the decision-making process, and the
> tools and applications that were used in reaching these
> conclusions."[^Bodard]

At the same time, musicians also need practical editions designed for
performance rather than for research.

Tondauer is a project to provide [Creative
Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) licensed musical
editions. For each piece, there is:

- A critical edition, including facsimiles of sources.
- A performance edition based on the critical edition, with notes
  referring to the critical edition where there are editorial choices
  that musicians may be especially interested in.
- [The source code of these
  editions](https://github.com/benjamingeer/Tondauer/), so that
  derived editions can be made.
