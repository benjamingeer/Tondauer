### What is Tondauer?

Tondauer (in German, the duration of a sound) is a project that aims
to support the longevity of compositions that deserve more attention
than they have received. Tondauer editions are [Creative
Commons](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) licensed, and are
intended to allow musicians to make informed choices about
interpretation.

> “Many musicians ... have no awareness of the importance of
> consciously choosing an edition; which criteria to apply; which
> criteria may have been applied in editing; why and how to make a
> good choice.”[^Rink]

> “On the other hand many musicians ... wanted to know about
> alternatives, about versions ... they wanted to shape their
> musical text and be responsible for it.”[^Urchueguía]

Musicians therefore need editions that allow them to check the
editor's choices and to see where different choices are possible. This
principle of transparency was developed for literary editions in the
1970s. The Frankfurt Hölderlin edition of 1975 presented:

> “a synoptic genetic text and a reading text with manuscript
> facsimiles accompanied by spatially oriented
> transcriptions.... [T]he facsimiles and transcriptions serve as a
> tool for the reader to check to a certain degree the editor's
> work.”[^Nutt-Kofoth]

By providing everything needed to reproduce each step of the editing
process, editors can make it possible for others to build on what they
have done while taking different approaches:

> “Open Source Critical Editions are more than merely presentations of
> finished work; they involve an essential distribution of the raw
> data, the scholarly tradition, the decision-making process, and the
> tools and applications that were used in reaching these
> conclusions.”[^Bodard]

At the same time, musicians need practical editions designed for
performance rather than for research.

For each piece published as part of this project, there is:

- A critical edition, including facsimiles of sources.
- In some cases, a separate performance edition based on the critical edition, with notes
  referring to the critical edition where there are editorial choices
  that musicians may be especially interested in.
- [The source code of these
  editions](https://github.com/benjamingeer/Tondauer/), so that
  derived editions can be made.

### Technology

Tondauer editions are made with [LilyPond](https://lilypond.org). The
reasons for this choice are explained in [LilyPond — Essay on
automated music
engraving](https://lilypond.org/doc/v2.22/Documentation/essay/index.html).
